<h3>The Story So Far</h3>

<p>I'm <%= link_to "Michael Taylor", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjt145" %>, a performance marketer who is slowly building OpenAdTools as I learn how to code. Having been introduced to the power of automation in using Microsoft Excel, I started coding as I dream of one day automating my entire job and taking off to travel the world.</p>

<p>As I got acquainted with the world of programming, I became increasingly dumbfounded by the hard-working, intelligent developers that would put in countless hours answering questions for free on <%= link_to "Stack Overflow", "http://stackoverflow.com/tour", target: "_blank" %>, writing <%= link_to "free tutorials", "http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book", target: "_blank" %>, and giving their work away on <%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/", target: "_blank" %>.</p>

<p>Thanks to their irrational generosity, I'm now in a position where I can start paying it forward. This site is a repository for whatever tools I build as I continue to learn. Hopefully you find the site useful and are in a position to pay it forward one day to someone else.</p>

<p>In order to make OpenAdTools as useful as possible, I'm designing every tool on this site under these three main principles:</p>

<h3>1) No Purchase Necessary</h3>
<p>These tools are, and always will be, free to use. Even if I turned evil you could just clone the source code in <%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/mjt145/openadtools", target: "_blank" %> and make your own version. I already have a day job so I don't need to hustle you for dolla, I'm just doin' it for the street cred.</p>

<h3>2) No Login Required</h3>
<p>I don't plan to spam you, so I don't need to force you to hand over your email address. I also don't want to make you remember yet another password, so every tool can be used without the need to login.</p>

<h3>3) No Personal Data Stored</h3>
<p>I want you to be able to use this tool without getting permission from your boss or worrying about my database being hacked, so none of these tools collect or store any valuable or personal data about you or your company.</p>

<h3>Questions, Suggestions, Criticisms</h3>
<p>I'm sure you'll run into issues with some of these tools, or you'll have great ideas about how to improve them. I really appreciate any feedback you can give me - Twitter is the best place to <%= link_to "contact me personally", "https://twitter.com/2michaeltaylor", target: "_blank" %>. If you're a developer (of any skill level) and you want to get involved, then 100% please get in touch - I'd love to have you contribute!</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Michael Taylor</p>
